### Context 

During the past few weeks I have been learning more about my tool JSON. Though this I have learned different ways to use it, how it works in general, how it is able to be converted and read by people or by the computer. In addition to this there are also eays to implement JSON code to make an event or mark something on a certain day. 

### Process 

Through many experiments I have come up with a minimum amount of inforrmation needed in order for such events to work. For example Some of the required parts to make a new event would be an ID, a date, the type of event that it would be and a few more.

```
id: 'event1', // Event's ID (required)
name: "New Year", // Event name (required)
date: "January/1/2023", // Event date (required)
type: "holiday", // Event type (required)

```


All of these varibles all come together to make a new event on the certain spot which would be the date that would be chosen. Without this basic information that marks the spot, gives the event and id to make sure it lines up correctly and there are not many copies of it everywhere, as well as the type of event that it is which can vary from what is chosen. An example of this is that the type could be either a holiday, a birthday, a national holiday so on so forth.

### Engeneering Design Process (EDP)

So far in my process I have made a working calendar that uses pre-input events to display them for different days that are chosen. I am intending on adding on my making it more flashier, adding different colors, making a mix of more events or things happening on different days and more. Maybe later on I would be able to add on more past just altering the colors to match better.

### Skills 

Some of the skills that I have is good at understanding physics and the logic behind things of why something happens. So the differences between some forces, how they are affected and different parts that would be important depending on the task.
